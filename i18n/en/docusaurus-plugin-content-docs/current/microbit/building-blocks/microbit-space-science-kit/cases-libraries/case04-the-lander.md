### Teamwork and Presentation

Students are divided into teams and work together to build and programme the lander.

Students are encouraged to co-operate, communicate and share their experiences with each other.

Each team will have the opportunity to show the other teams the lander they have made and demonstrate it.

**Expected Results:**After powering on, the lander descends to the moon along the lunar orbit.

### Summarise and Reflect

Review the lesson content to remind students what knowledge and skills they have acquired.

Lead students in a discussion about the problems and difficulties they encountered during the production process and how they solved them.

Guide students to think about the direction of optimisation and improvement of the lander, e.g. what other interesting cases can be produced.

## Extended Knowledge

The lander during a lunar landing is a key component in completing a lunar landing mission, responsible for safely bringing astronauts and scientific equipment from circumlunar orbit to the lunar surface and bringing astronauts back to circumlunar orbit after the mission is complete. The design of the lander is very complex and requires multiple functions to meet the challenges of the lunar environment. Here is some general knowledge about lander composition:

### Basic composition

1. **Lunar Module**:
   - This is the part of the lander that contains the astronauts, also known as the crew module or command module. It usually contains life support systems, communications equipment, navigation systems, and emergency escape devices.
2. **Propulsion module**:
   - Contains the main engines and propellant tanks, which are used to control the descent rate and direction of the lander to ensure a smooth landing and re-takeoff.
3. **Landing legs and cushions**:
   - Used to absorb shock during landing and prevent the lander from tipping over or being damaged.
4. **Solar panels**:
   - Provide electrical power, especially on long missions, for powering electronic equipment and keeping life support systems operational.
5. **Attitude Control System**:
   - Includes small thrusters and reaction wheels used to adjust the attitude of the lander in space.
6. **Navigation and guidance system**:
   - Uses laser range finders, inertial navigation units and astrometers to determine position and velocity and ensure accurate landings.
7. **Scientific instruments and laboratory equipment**:
   - May contain cameras, spectrometers, seismometers, etc., to perform scientific research and data collection.
8. **Lunar rovers or other ground vehicles**:
   - Some landers may carry lunar rovers or rovers so that astronauts can leave the lander for more extensive exploration.
9. **Sample collection and storage system**:
   - If the mission includes collection of lunar samples, the lander will contain equipment for sample collection and storage.

### Special design considerations

- **Power system**: In order to land and take off on the Moon, the lander must use a propulsion system different from that of chemical rockets, since there is no atmosphere on the Moon to generate lift. A combination of liquid fuel and oxidiser is usually used.
- **Weight and size constraints**: The lander must be as lightweight as possible to reduce launch costs and increase efficiency. At the same time, it needs to have enough space to accommodate astronauts and equipment.
- **Thermal control systems**: The temperature on the lunar surface is extremely variable, and the lander must be able to maintain a suitable temperature inside.
- **Redundant Systems**: To ensure the safety of the astronauts, many critical systems are backed up in case a component fails.

### Specific examples

- **US Apollo Eagle Lander**: consists of the Lunar Module and the Ascent Module, which is used for re-entry into circumlunar orbit.
- China's Range Lander**: part of China's manned lunar landing programme, designed to carry astronauts to and from the lunar surface.
- **NASA's Nova C lander**: fuelled by methane and oxygen and designed to explore the south polar region of the Moon.

The design of each lander will vary according to its specific mission requirements and the spacecraft architecture used.
