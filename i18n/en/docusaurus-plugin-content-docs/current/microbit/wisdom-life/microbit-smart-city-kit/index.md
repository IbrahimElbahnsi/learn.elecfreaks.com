The Smart City Kit has a well-selection of IoT:bit, DHT11 sensor, soil moisture sensor, water level sensor, sonar:bit, servos and etc., we could use it to build such themes as the smart parking lot, transportation network and river level monitoringâ€¦, we can use it to learn more about the IoT and program, and more possibilities of the future city scenes are able to be constructed via it!
