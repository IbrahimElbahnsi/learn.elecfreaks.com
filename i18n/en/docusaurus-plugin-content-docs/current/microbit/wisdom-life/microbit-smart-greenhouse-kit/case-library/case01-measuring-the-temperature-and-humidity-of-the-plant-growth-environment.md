## Expand knowledge

**Smart greenhouse**: Smart greenhouse is a facility that uses modern scientific and technological means to monitor, adjust and manage the environment in the greenhouse through an automated control system. It uses various sensors and actuators, combined with data acquisition, analysis and processing technologies, to achieve real-time monitoring and adjustment of environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, light, and carbon dioxide concentration in the greenhouse to improve the growth quality and yield of crops.

Smart greenhouses usually include the following features and functions:

1. Real-time monitoring and data recording of environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, light, and carbon dioxide concentration;

2. Automated greenhouse ventilation, shading, and irrigation systems, which can be automatically adjusted according to environmental parameters;

3. Intelligent lighting system, which can be intelligently controlled according to crop needs and light time;

4. Remote monitoring and control functions, which can remotely monitor and control the greenhouse environment in real time through mobile phones or computers;

5. Data analysis and prediction functions, which provide decision support through analysis and prediction of collected data.

The application of smart greenhouses can effectively improve the growth rate, yield and quality of crops, reduce the waste of energy and resources, reduce production costs, and also reduce the impact on the environment. Therefore, it has been widely used and promoted in modern agricultural production.
