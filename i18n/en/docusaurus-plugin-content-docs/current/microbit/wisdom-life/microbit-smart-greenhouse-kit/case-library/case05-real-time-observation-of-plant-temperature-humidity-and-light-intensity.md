## Teaching process

### Course introduction

In the previous courses, we gradually learned how to obtain the temperature data, soil moisture data, and sunlight intensity data of the plant growth environment through programming, and change the soil moisture and light intensity of the plant through a 3V water pump and 8 rainbow light rings, and learned to view the temperature data and soil moisture data through the IOT platform ThingSpeak. In this class, we will combine all the knowledge points learned in the previous lessons and observe the data that needs to be detected during the plant growth process through programming and display it on the ThingSpeak platform.

Now, let's get started!

### Exploration activities

- How to obtain all the data that needs to be detected during the plant growth process through programming?

- How to use the ThingSpeak platform to view all the detected data?

### Assemble the smart greenhouse

Insert the micro:bit into the IOT:bit expansion board, apply traceless glue on the back of the IOT:bit expansion board, and fix it to the base of the greenhouse model, as shown below:

### Teamwork and Presentation

Students are divided into groups to complete the installation and programming of the smart greenhouse.

Encourage students to cooperate, communicate and share experiences with each other.

Each group has the opportunity to show the smart greenhouse they made to other groups and demonstrate.

**Expected effect:** When the soil moisture value of the plant growth is less than 200, the water pump starts to pump water and deliver it to the plant growth pool.

- ### Summary and reflection

  Review the course content and remind students what knowledge and skills they have mastered.

  Guide students to discuss the problems and difficulties they encountered during the production process and how to solve these problems.

  Guide students to think about the optimization and improvement of the program, such as what interesting cases can be made with micro:bit.

  ## Expand knowledge

  ThingSpeak is an Internet of Things (IoT) platform that allows users to collect, analyze, and distribute data from sensors. It is particularly suitable for developers and enthusiasts who want to quickly set up and test IoT applications without building a complete backend service themselves.

  ### Main functions:

  1. **Data collection**: Collect data from various sensors through HTTP POST requests or using MATLAB API.

  2. **Data storage**: Store the collected data in a "channel" in the cloud.

  3. **Data analysis**: Use MATLAB or other tools to analyze data in real time.

  4. **Data visualization**: Create charts and dashboards to display data.

  5. **Event triggering**: When the data reaches a certain threshold, ThingSpeak can be configured to send an email, SMS, or perform other actions.
  6. **Data Sharing**: Data in a channel can be shared publicly or kept private.

  ### Use cases:

  - **Environmental Monitoring**: Monitor temperature, humidity, etc.

  - **Home Automation**: Monitor and control smart home devices.

  - **Industrial Monitoring**: Monitor machine status, production line efficiency, etc.

  - **Health Monitoring**: Track personal health indicators such as heart rate, number of steps, etc.
